# Feature Specification: Chat Session Management

*   **Feature Name**: Chat Session Management
*   **Feature ID**: CHAT-001
*   **Status**: Completed

## 1. Description

This feature enables users to initiate new chat sessions, retrieve and view their past conversation histories, and seamlessly continue existing chat sessions. It ensures that user interactions with the chatbot are persistent and organized.

## 2. User Stories / Use Cases

*   **As a user**, I want to start a new chat session so I can ask the chatbot new questions.
*   **As a user**, I want to view my past chat sessions so I can review previous conversations.
*   **As a user**, I want to continue an existing chat session so I don't lose context and can pick up where I left off.
*   **As a user**, I want my chat history to be associated with my account so it's always available when I log in.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR-CHAT-001**: The system SHALL allow an authenticated user to create a new chat session.
*   **FR-CHAT-002**: Each chat session SHALL have a unique identifier.
*   **FR-CHAT-003**: The system SHALL associate all messages within a session with that session's ID.
*   **FR-CHAT-004**: The system SHALL allow an authenticated user to retrieve a list of all their chat sessions.
*   **FR-CHAT-005**: For a given chat session ID, the system SHALL retrieve all messages belonging to that session, ordered chronologically.
*   **FR-CHAT-006**: The system SHALL store the timestamp of each message and session creation.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

*   **NFR-CHAT-001 (Performance)**: Retrieving a list of chat sessions SHALL complete within 1 second.
*   **NFR-CHAT-002 (Performance)**: Retrieving all messages for a session SHALL complete within 2 seconds for sessions with up to 100 messages.
*   **NFR-CHAT-003 (Data Integrity)**: All messages SHALL be correctly associated with their respective chat sessions and users.

## 5. Technical Design

*   **Backend Endpoints**:
    *   `POST /api/chat/sessions`: Create a new chat session.
    *   `GET /api/chat/sessions`: Retrieve all chat sessions for the authenticated user.
    *   `GET /api/chat/sessions/:sessionId/messages`: Retrieve messages for a specific session.
*   **Database Schema**:
    *   `ChatSession` model: `userId (ref to User)`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
    *   `Message` model: `sessionId (ref to ChatSession)`, `sender (User/Chatbot)`, `content`, `timestamp`.
*   **Relationships**: `User` has many `ChatSession`s; `ChatSession` has many `Message`s.
*   **Authentication**: All chat session endpoints will be protected by authentication middleware.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations

*   **New Chat Button**: A clear button to start a fresh conversation.
*   **Chat History List**: A navigable list displaying past chat sessions, possibly with a brief summary or timestamp.
*   **Chat Window**: Displays messages chronologically within a selected session.
*   **Session Switching**: Easy mechanism to switch between active and past sessions.

## 7. Dependencies

*   Backend API (Node.js/Express)
*   MongoDB Database
*   User Authentication feature (AUTH-001)

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

*   An authenticated user can successfully create a new chat session.
*   New messages sent by the user are correctly saved and associated with the current session.
*   The user can view a list of all their past chat sessions.
*   The user can select a past session and view all messages from that session in chronological order.
*   Messages sent in a session are correctly attributed to the user or the chatbot.
