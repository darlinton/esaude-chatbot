# Feature Specification: User Authentication

*   **Feature Name**: User Authentication
*   **Feature ID**: AUTH-001
*   **Status**: Completed

## 1. Description

This feature provides mechanisms for users to register new accounts, log in to existing accounts, and manage their authenticated sessions within the `esaude-chatbot` application. It ensures that user-specific data (like chat history) can be securely accessed and maintained.

## 2. User Stories / Use Cases

*   **As a new user**, I want to register an account so I can access the chatbot's features and save my chat history.
*   **As an existing user**, I want to log in to my account so I can continue my previous conversations and access my profile.
*   **As a logged-in user**, I want my session to be secure and persistent so I don't have to log in frequently.
*   **As a logged-in user**, I want to be able to log out of my account for security reasons.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR-AUTH-001**: The system SHALL allow users to register with a unique email address and a password.
*   **FR-AUTH-002**: The system SHALL validate user input during registration (e.g., email format, password strength).
*   **FR-AUTH-003**: The system SHALL securely hash and store user passwords.
*   **FR-AUTH-004**: The system SHALL allow registered users to log in using their email and password.
*   **FR-AUTH-005**: Upon successful login, the system SHALL issue a JSON Web Token (JWT) for session management.
*   **FR-AUTH-006**: The system SHALL protect API endpoints requiring authentication using the issued JWT.
*   **FR-AUTH-007**: The system SHALL allow users to log out, invalidating their current session token.
*   **FR-AUTH-008**: The system SHALL provide appropriate error messages for failed registration or login attempts (e.g., "Email already exists", "Invalid credentials").

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

*   **NFR-AUTH-001 (Security)**: Passwords SHALL be stored using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
*   **NFR-AUTH-002 (Security)**: JWTs SHALL be transmitted over HTTPS/SSL.
*   **NFR-AUTH-003 (Security)**: JWTs SHALL have an appropriate expiration time.
*   **NFR-AUTH-004 (Performance)**: Login and registration processes SHALL complete within 1 second.

## 5. Technical Design

*   **Backend Endpoints**:
    *   `POST /api/auth/signup`: User registration.
    *   `POST /api/auth/login`: User login.
    *   `POST /api/auth/logout`: User logout.
*   **Database Schema**:
    *   `User` model: `email (unique)`, `password (hashed)`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
*   **Authentication Middleware**: A middleware function (`authMiddleware.js`) will verify JWTs for protected routes.
*   **Password Hashing**: `bcrypt.js` library will be used for hashing and comparing passwords.
*   **Token Management**: `jsonwebtoken` library will be used for creating and verifying JWTs.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations

*   **Login Form**: Fields for email and password, "Forgot Password" link (future feature).
*   **Sign Up Form**: Fields for email, password, confirm password.
*   **Error Display**: Clear and concise error messages displayed near the relevant input fields or as a general alert.
*   **Navigation**: "Login" and "Sign Up" links visible when not authenticated; "Logout" link visible when authenticated.

## 7. Dependencies

*   Backend API (Node.js/Express)
*   MongoDB Database
*   `bcrypt` library
*   `jsonwebtoken` library

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

*   A new user can successfully register an account.
*   A registered user can successfully log in.
*   An invalid email or password prevents login.
*   An attempt to register with an already existing email fails with an appropriate message.
*   Protected routes are inaccessible without a valid token.
*   Users can successfully log out, and their token becomes invalid.
