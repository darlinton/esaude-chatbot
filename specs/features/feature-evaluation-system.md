# Feature Specification: Chatbot Response Evaluation

*   **Feature Name**: Chatbot Response Evaluation
*   **Feature ID**: EVAL-001
*   **Status**: Completed

## 1. Description

This feature provides users with the ability to evaluate the quality and helpfulness of the chatbot's responses. This feedback mechanism is crucial for continuous improvement of the chatbot's performance and accuracy.

## 2. User Stories / Use Cases

*   **As a user**, I want to rate a chatbot's response (e.g., thumbs up/down) so I can provide quick feedback on its helpfulness.
*   **As a user**, I want to provide detailed textual feedback on a chatbot's response so I can explain why it was helpful or unhelpful.
*   **As an administrator/developer**, I want to view evaluation data so I can identify areas for chatbot improvement.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR-EVAL-001**: The system SHALL allow an authenticated user to submit a rating (e.g., positive/negative, 1-5 stars) for a specific chatbot message.
*   **FR-EVAL-002**: The system SHALL allow an authenticated user to submit optional textual comments along with their rating for a chatbot message.
*   **FR-EVAL-003**: Each evaluation SHALL be linked to the specific message, chat session, and user who provided the feedback.
*   **FR-EVAL-004**: The system SHALL prevent a user from submitting multiple evaluations for the same message.
*   **FR-EVAL-005**: The system SHALL store evaluation data in the database.
*   **FR-EVAL-006**: The system SHALL provide an API for administrators to retrieve evaluation data (e.g., by message, by session, overall).

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

*   **NFR-EVAL-001 (Usability)**: The evaluation mechanism should be easily accessible and intuitive within the chat interface.
*   **NFR-EVAL-002 (Data Integrity)**: Evaluation data must accurately reflect the user's feedback and be correctly associated with the corresponding messages.
*   **NFR-EVAL-003 (Performance)**: Submitting an evaluation SHALL not significantly impact the chat experience.

## 5. Technical Design

*   **Backend Endpoints**:
    *   `POST /api/evaluations`: Submit a new evaluation for a message.
    *   `GET /api/evaluations`: (Admin only) Retrieve all evaluations.
    *   `GET /api/evaluations/message/:messageId`: (Admin only) Retrieve evaluations for a specific message.
*   **Database Schema**:
    *   `Evaluation` model: `userId (ref to User)`, `messageId (ref to Message)`, `rating (Number/String)`, `comment (String, optional)`, `createdAt`.
*   **Relationships**: `Message` has many `Evaluation`s.
*   **Authentication**: All evaluation submission endpoints will require user authentication. Admin retrieval endpoints will require additional authorization.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations

*   **Evaluation Widget**: A small UI element (e.g., thumbs up/down icons, star rating) displayed near each chatbot response.
*   **Feedback Form**: A modal or expandable text area for detailed comments.
*   **Confirmation**: Visual feedback to the user that their evaluation has been submitted.

## 7. Dependencies

*   Backend API (Node.js/Express)
*   MongoDB Database
*   User Authentication feature (AUTH-001)
*   Message Exchange feature (MSG-001)

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

*   A user can successfully submit a rating for a chatbot message.
*   A user can successfully submit a rating with an optional comment.
*   The evaluation is correctly linked to the message, session, and user.
*   A user cannot submit multiple evaluations for the same message.
*   Evaluation data can be retrieved by administrators via the API.
