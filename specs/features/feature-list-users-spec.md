# Feature Specification: List Users Script

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the specification for a new backend script designed to list all users currently stored in the database. This script is intended to be a utility for administrators, specifically to aid in the execution of the existing `upgradeUser` script by providing a clear list of available users.

## 2. Functionality

The script will perform the following actions:

*   **Database Connection**: Establish a connection to the application's primary database. Connection details should be sourced from environment variables or a configuration file.
*   **User Data Retrieval**: Query the database for all records in the `users` table.
*   **Data Formatting**: Present the retrieved user data in a clear and readable format. This should include, at a minimum, user ID, username, email, and role.
*   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for potential issues such as database connection failures or query errors. Inform the administrator of any problems encountered.

## 3. Usage

This script is intended to be executed from the command line within the backend environment. An administrator would typically run it using a command like:

```bash
node scripts/listUsers.js
```

(Note: The exact script name and execution command will be finalized during implementation.)

## 4. Dependencies

*   Database driver/ORM (e.g., `pg`, `mysql2`, `sequelize`, `prisma`)
*   Environment variable management (e.g., `dotenv`)

## 5. Assumptions

*   A `users` table exists in the database with relevant user information.
*   Database connection credentials are securely managed and accessible via environment variables or configuration.
*   The backend environment has the necessary Node.js modules installed.
