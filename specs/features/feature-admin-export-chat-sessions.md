# Feature: Export Chat Sessions as CSV

## Description

This feature allows administrators to export all chat sessions, including their respective messages, into a single CSV file. This functionality is crucial for data analysis, archival, and compliance purposes, allowing for offline review and processing of user interactions.

## 1. User Stories / Use Cases

*   **As a system administrator**, I want to be able to export all chat sessions and their messages to a CSV file so that I can perform detailed analysis on user interactions.
*   **As a system administrator**, I want a simple "Export to CSV" button on the session management page so that I can easily download the data.
*   **As a system administrator**, I want the exported CSV file to be well-structured and include key information such as session ID, user ID, message content, and timestamps, so that the data is easy to parse and understand.

## 2. Functional Requirements

*   **FR-ADMIN-008**: The system SHALL provide a button or link on the admin session management page to trigger the export of all chat sessions.
*   **FR-ADMIN-009**: The export process SHALL generate a CSV file containing all chat sessions and their associated messages.
*   **FR-ADMIN-010**: The CSV file SHALL include the following columns: `SessionID`, `UserID`, `MessageID`, `MessageContent`, `Sender`, `Timestamp`.
*   **FR-ADMIN-011**: The export functionality SHALL be accessible only to users with the "Admin" role.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements

*   **NFR-ADMIN-005 (Performance)**: The export process should be optimized to handle a large volume of chat sessions and messages without causing significant server load or timeouts.
*   **NFR-ADMIN-006 (Security)**: The exported data may contain sensitive information and should be handled securely. Access to the export functionality must be strictly limited to authorized administrators.
*   **NFR-ADMIN-007 (Usability)**: The export process should be initiated with a single click, and the file download should start automatically.

## 4. Technical Design

*   **Backend Endpoint**:
    *   `GET /api/admin/sessions/export`: A new endpoint to handle the logic for exporting chat sessions. This endpoint will fetch all sessions and messages, format them into a CSV string, and send the response with appropriate headers to trigger a file download.
*   **CSV Generation**:
    *   A library such as `papaparse` or a custom utility function will be used on the backend to convert the JSON data from the database into a CSV formatted string.
*   **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   An "Export to CSV" button will be added to the `AdminDashboardPage.js` component.
    *   An API call will be made from the frontend to the `/api/admin/sessions/export` endpoint. The response, which will be the CSV file, will be handled to initiate a download in the user's browser.

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

*   **Button Placement**: The "Export to CSV" button should be prominently placed on the `AdminDashboardPage`, likely near the top of the session list.
*   **Feedback**: The UI should provide feedback to the user that the export is in progress, for example, by showing a loading spinner on the button after it's clicked.

## 6. Dependencies

*   Backend API (Node.js/Express)
*   MongoDB Database
*   Existing `ChatSession` and `Message` models.
*   A CSV generation library (e.g., `papaparse` or similar).

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

*   An "Admin" user can click the "Export to CSV" button on the admin dashboard.
*   A CSV file is successfully downloaded to the user's computer.
*   The CSV file contains all chat sessions and messages with the specified columns.
*   Non-admin users cannot access the export functionality.
